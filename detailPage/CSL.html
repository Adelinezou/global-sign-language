    <h2>Chinese Sign Language</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Chinese Sign Language (CSL)</strong> is the primary sign language used by the Deaf community in China.
        It is a natural language that encompasses a variety of regional sign languages and gestures used by Deaf
        individuals
        throughout the country. CSL has its own grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, distinct from spoken Chinese.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        The development of CSL began in the late 19th century with the establishment of schools for the Deaf in China.
        Over the years, CSL has evolved from a mix of local sign languages, gestures, and influences from other sign
        languages.
        It has gained recognition and standardization, particularly with the efforts of organizations dedicated to Deaf
        education.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        CSL is widely used by the Deaf community in China and is an essential part of their cultural identity.
        Many hearing individuals, including family members and interpreters, also learn CSL to communicate with Deaf
        individuals.
        The rise of media representation and educational initiatives has contributed to greater awareness and
        understanding of CSL.

    <h3>Distinct Features of CSL</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSL is a visual-gestural language, relying on hand shapes, movements, and facial expressions to convey
            meaning.</li>
        <li>It has its own unique grammatical structure, often different from spoken Chinese, including the use of
            classifiers.</li>
        <li>Facial expressions are critical for conveying emotions, tone, and questions in CSL.</li>
        <li>CSL incorporates fingerspelling for proper names and specific terms, similar to many other sign languages.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CSL in Education</h3>
    <p>
        Chinese Sign Language is taught in schools for the Deaf across China and is recognized as a second language in
        various educational settings.
        Efforts are being made to improve Deaf education, including incorporating CSL into curricula to facilitate
        better learning opportunities for Deaf students.
