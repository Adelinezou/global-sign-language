    <h2>Korean Sign Language (KSL)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Korean Sign Language (KSL)</strong> is the predominant sign language used by the Deaf community in South
        Korea. It is a fully developed, natural language that uses hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements
        to convey meaning, distinct from both spoken Korean and other sign languages.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        KSL has its roots in the early 20th century when Deaf education began to take form in Korea. Initially
        influenced by American Sign Language (ASL) and Japanese Sign Language, KSL has evolved into a unique language
        that reflects the cultural and social context of the Korean Deaf community.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        KSL is widely used by Deaf individuals in South Korea and is an integral part of their cultural identity. It
        fosters communication not only among Deaf individuals but also with hearing family members, friends, and
        interpreters, enhancing social inclusion.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of KSL</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>KSL is a visual language that relies on hand shapes, facial expressions, and body language to convey
            meaning.</li>
        <li>It has its own grammatical structure, which is different from spoken Korean. KSL often follows a unique
            sentence order and uses various non-manual signals.</li>
        <li>Facial expressions are crucial for indicating emotions and grammatical features such as questions and
            negations.</li>
        <li>KSL includes fingerspelling for proper nouns and words that do not have an established sign.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>KSL in Education</h3>
    <p>
        KSL is taught in schools for the Deaf across South Korea, and many universities offer courses in KSL as a
        foreign language. Education programs incorporating KSL help facilitate learning in a language that is natural
        for Deaf students.
