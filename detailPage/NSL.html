        fully developed language with its own grammar and vocabulary, distinct from spoken Nepali.

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>

        NSL has evolved from a combination of local sign languages and gestures used by the Deaf community in Nepal. Its
        development has been influenced by the cultural and linguistic diversity of the country.

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>

        NSL is used by Deaf individuals and their families, as well as interpreters and educators. The language serves
        as a crucial means of communication and is integral to the identity of the Deaf community in Nepal.
