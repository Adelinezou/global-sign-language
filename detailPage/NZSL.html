    <h2>New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL)</strong> is one of the official languages of New Zealand and serves as
        the primary sign language for the Deaf community in the country. It is a fully developed language with its own
        grammar and vocabulary, distinct from spoken English.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        NZSL evolved in the 19th century with the establishment of the first schools for the Deaf in New Zealand. It has
        roots in British Sign Language and incorporates elements from regional sign languages, creating a unique
        linguistic environment reflective of New Zealand's cultural identity.

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>

        NZSL is used by the Deaf community, their families, interpreters, and educators. It plays a crucial role in
        promoting Deaf culture and identity, as well as advocating for the rights and inclusion of Deaf individuals in
        society.
