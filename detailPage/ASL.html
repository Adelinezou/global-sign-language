    <h2>American Sign Language</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>American Sign Language (ASL)</strong> is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language
        of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada. ASL is a complete, complex language that
        uses hand signs, facial expressions, and body movements to convey meaning. It has its own syntax, grammar, and
        vocabulary that are distinct from spoken English, making it a fully autonomous language.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        The origins of ASL can be traced back to the early 19th century when Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, an American
        educator, traveled to France to learn about European methods for teaching Deaf children. There, he met Laurent
        Clerc, a Deaf French educator, and together they established the first American school for the Deaf in Hartford,
        Connecticut in 1817. ASL evolved from the mixing of French Sign Language (LSF) and regional sign languages and
        gestures used in the United States at the time.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        ASL is used not only by the Deaf community but also by hearing family members, interpreters, and others who
        interact regularly with Deaf individuals. The Deaf community in the United States often views ASL as an integral
        part of their cultural identity, and its use is a point of pride.
        ASL is also used in many academic institutions as a recognized second language, and it has gained wider
        awareness through media and educational programs.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of ASL</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ASL is a visual and gestural language, relying on the movement of hands, face, and body.</li>
        <li>It has its own grammatical structure that is different from spoken English. For instance, word order in ASL
            often follows a "topic-comment" structure rather than the typical Subject-Verb-Object order of English.</li>
        <li>Facial expressions play a crucial role in conveying tone, questions, and emphasis in ASL.</li>
        <li>It incorporates finger spelling, where the alphabet is spelled out letter by letter to convey names or
            specific terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ASL in Education</h3>
    <p>
        ASL is used in schools for the Deaf across the U.S. and is taught in universities as a foreign language. Several
        Deaf education programs incorporate ASL into the curriculum, enabling Deaf students to learn in their native
        language while also becoming proficient in written English.
