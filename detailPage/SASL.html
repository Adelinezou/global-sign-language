    <h2>South African Sign Language (SASL)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>South African Sign Language (SASL)</strong> is the primary sign language used by the Deaf community in
        South Africa. It is a fully developed language with its own grammar and vocabulary, distinct from spoken
        languages in the country.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        SASL has its roots in the early 20th century, evolving from a mix of local sign languages and gestures used by
        Deaf individuals. It has been shaped by the diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds of its users, making it
        a unique form of communication within South Africa.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        SASL is used by Deaf individuals, their families, interpreters, and educators. The language plays a vital role
        in the cultural identity of the Deaf community and is increasingly recognized in educational and social
        settings.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of SASL</h3>

        <li>The grammar of SASL is distinct from English and other spoken languages, employing its own syntax.</li>
        <li>Facial expressions are crucial for conveying tone and grammatical information.</li>
