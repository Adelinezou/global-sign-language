    <h2>Indonesian Sign Language (BISINDO)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Indonesian Sign Language (BISINDO)</strong> is the sign language used by the Deaf community in
        Indonesia. It is a natural language that has its own grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, distinct from spoken
        Indonesian and other sign languages.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        BISINDO emerged in the late 20th century as a result of the efforts of Deaf educators and community members who
        sought to establish a standardized form of sign language. It has evolved over time, influenced by local dialects
        and other sign languages, to better serve the diverse needs of the Indonesian Deaf community.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        BISINDO is widely used by Deaf individuals in Indonesia, as well as their families, friends, and interpreters.
        It plays a significant role in the cultural identity of the Deaf community, facilitating communication and
        social interaction among members.
