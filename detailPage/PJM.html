    <h2>Polish Sign Language (PJM)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Polish Sign Language (PJM)</strong> is the primary sign language used by the Deaf community in Poland.
        It is a natural language with its own grammar, vocabulary, and structure, distinct from spoken Polish.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        PJM emerged in the late 20th century as the Deaf community in Poland began to organize and advocate for their
        rights. The language developed from various regional signs and gestures, creating a rich linguistic tradition
        that reflects the cultural identity of Deaf individuals in Poland.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        PJM is used primarily by Deaf individuals and their families, as well as by interpreters and educators. The Deaf
        community in Poland values PJM as a vital part of their cultural heritage, and its use fosters communication and
        understanding among members of the community.
