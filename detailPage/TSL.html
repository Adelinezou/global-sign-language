    <h2>Thai Sign Language (TSL)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Thai Sign Language (TSL)</strong> is the sign language used by the Deaf community in Thailand. It is a
        natural language with its own grammar, vocabulary, and structure, distinct from spoken Thai.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        The origins of Thai Sign Language can be traced back to the 20th century, influenced by various regional sign
        languages and gestures. TSL has evolved over the years, incorporating elements from local dialects and the
        education system for Deaf individuals in Thailand.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        TSL is primarily used by the Deaf community in Thailand, including Deaf students, families, and educators. The
        language plays an essential role in communication, cultural identity, and social interactions among Deaf
        individuals in the country.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of TSL</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>TSL is a visual and gestural language, utilizing hand shapes, facial expressions, and body movements to
            convey meaning.</li>
        <li>The grammar of TSL differs from spoken Thai, with a unique structure that allows for expressive
            communication.</li>
        <li>Facial expressions are crucial in TSL for indicating emotions, questions, and negations.</li>
        <li>Fingerspelling is used in TSL for spelling out names and specific terms without dedicated signs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>TSL in Education</h3>
    <p>
        TSL is taught in specialized schools for the Deaf across Thailand, providing students with access to education
        in their native language. Efforts are ongoing to promote TSL in mainstream education, enhancing inclusivity and
        communication for Deaf students.
