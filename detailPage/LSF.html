    <h2>French Sign Language</h2>

    <p><strong>French Sign Language (Langue des Signes Française - LSF)</strong> is the primary sign language used by
        the Deaf community in France. It is a naturally evolving language with its own grammar, syntax, and structure,
        distinct from spoken French.</p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>LSF has deep historical roots and was one of the earliest formalized sign languages in Europe. Its development
        was formalized in the 18th century by the Abbé Charles-Michel de l'Épée, who is known as the "father of Deaf
        education." LSF was instrumental in the creation of many other sign languages worldwide, including ASL.</p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>LSF is used throughout France and in some regions of Switzerland. The Deaf community in France views LSF as an
        integral part of their identity, and it has been officially recognized by the French government since 2005.</p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of LSF</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LSF has a rich use of space to indicate tense, subjects, and objects.</li>
        <li>Like ASL, LSF is a visual language with its own grammar distinct from spoken French.</li>
        <li>Facial expressions and body movements play a significant role in conveying meaning.</li>
    </ul>
