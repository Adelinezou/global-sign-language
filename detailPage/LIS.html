    <h2>Italian Sign Language (LIS)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Italian Sign Language (LIS)</strong> is the sign language used by the Deaf community in Italy. It is a
        fully developed natural language with its own grammar and vocabulary, distinct from spoken Italian.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        The origins of LIS date back to the early 19th century, with influences from various regional sign languages and
        gestures used across Italy. In 1880, the Milan Conference on Deaf Education had a significant impact on the use
        of sign languages in Italy, leading to the widespread adoption of LIS in educational institutions for the Deaf.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        LIS is primarily used by Deaf individuals in Italy, along with their families, friends, and interpreters. The
        Deaf community in Italy values LIS as a key component of their cultural identity, and its use fosters strong
        connections within the community.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of LIS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LIS is a visual language that employs hand shapes, facial expressions, and body movements to convey meaning.
        </li>
        <li>It has its own grammatical structure, which differs from spoken Italian, often employing a "topic-comment"
            order.</li>
        <li>Facial expressions play an essential role in conveying emotions and grammatical features, such as questions
            or negations.</li>
        <li>LIS includes fingerspelling for spelling out names, places, or terms that lack specific signs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>LIS in Education</h3>
    <p>
        LIS is taught in schools for the Deaf throughout Italy and is increasingly recognized in mainstream educational
        contexts. Many Deaf education programs incorporate LIS to facilitate learning and enhance communication.
