    <h2>Japanese Sign Language</h2>

    <p><strong>Japanese Sign Language (日本手話, Nihon Shuwa)</strong> is the sign language used by the Deaf community in
        Japan. JSL has its own grammar and structure, distinct from both spoken Japanese and the manual Japanese
        syllabary.</p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>JSL has been used in Japan for centuries, with formal Deaf education beginning in the late 19th century. The
        Japanese Federation of the Deaf was established in 1947, advocating for JSL and the rights of Deaf individuals
        in Japan.</p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>JSL is widely used by the Deaf community in Japan. It is also taught in schools for the Deaf, and more recently
        has gained visibility through media and government recognition. In 2011, JSL was officially recognized as a
        language by the Japanese government.</p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of JSL</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>JSL uses a combination of hand signs and facial expressions to convey meaning.</li>
        <li>Unlike many other sign languages, JSL has a system of manual signs that represent the Japanese syllabary.
        </li>
        <li>JSL incorporates visual symbols and motions that are culturally unique to Japan.</li>
    </ul>
