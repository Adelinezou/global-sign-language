    <h2>Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL)</strong> is the predominant sign language used by the Deaf community in
        Vietnam. It is a fully developed language that uses visual signs to communicate and has its own grammar and
        vocabulary, distinct from spoken Vietnamese.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        VSL has its roots in the late 20th century as a means for Deaf individuals in Vietnam to communicate
        effectively. Its development has been influenced by regional sign languages and gestures, creating a unique
        linguistic landscape that represents the cultural identity of the Deaf community in Vietnam.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        VSL is utilized by Deaf individuals, their families, educators, and interpreters. The Deaf community in Vietnam
        views VSL as an essential aspect of their cultural identity and uses it to promote awareness of Deaf culture and
        rights within society.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of VSL</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>VSL is a visual-gestural language, relying on hand shapes, facial expressions, and body movements to convey
            meaning.</li>
        <li>The grammar of VSL differs significantly from spoken Vietnamese, using its own unique syntax and structure.
        </li>
        <li>Facial expressions play a critical role in conveying tone, emotion, and grammatical information in VSL.</li>
        <li>Fingerspelling is used in VSL for spelling out names and specific terms not represented by established
            signs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>VSL in Education</h3>
    <p>
        VSL is increasingly recognized in educational settings for Deaf students in Vietnam. Specialized schools and
        programs utilize VSL as a medium of instruction, ensuring that Deaf students can learn in their native language
        while becoming proficient in written Vietnamese.
