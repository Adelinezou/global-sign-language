    <h2>Russian Sign Language (RSL)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Russian Sign Language (RSL)</strong> is the sign language used by the Deaf community in Russia and some
        other post-Soviet states. It is a natural language with its own grammar, vocabulary, and syntax, distinct from
        both Russian spoken language and other sign languages.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        RSL has evolved since the 18th century, heavily influenced by French Sign Language (LSF) during the
        establishment of the first Deaf schools in Russia. The language has developed its own unique features over time,
        shaped by regional variations and the diverse Deaf community across Russia.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        RSL is predominantly used by Deaf individuals in Russia. It serves as a crucial means of communication not only
        among the Deaf community but also with hearing family members and friends. The use of RSL is deeply tied to
        cultural identity and pride within the Deaf community.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of RSL</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>RSL utilizes a variety of hand shapes, movements, and facial expressions to convey meaning.</li>
        <li>It has its own grammatical structure, which differs from Russian, often utilizing a "topic-comment" format.
        </li>
        <li>Facial expressions are vital in RSL for expressing emotions, negation, and questioning.</li>
        <li>RSL incorporates fingerspelling to represent proper nouns and words without established signs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>RSL in Education</h3>
    <p>
        RSL is taught in specialized schools for the Deaf in Russia. There is a growing recognition of the importance of
        teaching RSL as a means of ensuring educational access and inclusivity for Deaf students.
