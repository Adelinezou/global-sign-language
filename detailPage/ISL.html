    <h2>Indian Sign Language (ISL)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Indian Sign Language (ISL)</strong> is the sign language used by the Deaf community in India. It is a
        natural, visual language that has its own syntax, grammar, and vocabulary, making it distinct from spoken
        languages like Hindi and English.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        ISL developed in India and has been influenced by various regional sign languages and gestures. The language
        gained recognition in the late 20th century as awareness grew regarding the rights and identities of Deaf
        individuals in India.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        ISL is predominantly used by the Deaf community in India and is also learned by hearing individuals who interact
        with Deaf people, such as family members and interpreters. The community advocates for the recognition and
        rights of Deaf individuals, promoting the use of ISL in education and public life.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of ISL</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ISL is a visual language that uses hand shapes, facial expressions, and body movements to convey meaning.
        </li>
        <li>It has its own grammatical structure, which is different from that of spoken languages in India. For
            instance, ISL often uses a "topic-comment" structure.</li>
        <li>Facial expressions play an important role in conveying emotions, questions, and grammatical features.</li>
        <li>ISL includes fingerspelling for spelling out names and specific terms, using a distinct alphabet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ISL in Education</h3>
    <p>
        ISL is taught in various educational institutions for the Deaf across India, promoting literacy and
        communication skills. Some organizations are working towards incorporating ISL into mainstream education to
        facilitate better communication and understanding.
