    <h2>Spanish Sign Language (LSE)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Spanish Sign Language</strong>, known as <strong>Lengua de Signos Española (LSE)</strong>, is the sign
        language used by the Deaf community in Spain. It is a complete language with its own grammar and vocabulary,
        distinct from both spoken Spanish and other sign languages.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        The origins of LSE can be traced back to the early 19th century, influenced by regional sign languages and
        gestures used by Deaf individuals across Spain. The establishment of formal Deaf education in the country helped
        in the development and standardization of LSE.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        LSE is predominantly used by the Deaf community in Spain, but it is also employed by hearing family members,
        friends, and interpreters. It serves as a vital means of communication and plays an essential role in the
        cultural identity of the Deaf community in Spain.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of LSE</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LSE is a visual language that employs hand signs, facial expressions, and body movements to convey meaning.
        </li>
        <li>It has its own grammatical structure, which differs from spoken Spanish, often utilizing a different word
            order and incorporation of gestures.</li>
        <li>Facial expressions are integral for expressing emotions and indicating questions or affirmations.</li>
        <li>LSE includes fingerspelling to represent proper nouns and specific terms that lack dedicated signs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>LSE in Education</h3>
    <p>
        LSE is taught in schools for the Deaf throughout Spain and is increasingly recognized in mainstream educational
        settings. Many educational institutions incorporate LSE into their curricula to foster an inclusive learning
        environment.
