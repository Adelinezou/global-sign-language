    <h2>Venezuelan Sign Language (LSV)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Venezuelan Sign Language (LSV)</strong> is the sign language used by the Deaf community in Venezuela. It
        is a fully developed language with its own grammar and vocabulary, distinct from spoken Spanish.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        LSV has developed over time, influenced by a variety of regional sign languages and local gestures. The language
        reflects the cultural diversity of Venezuela and has grown alongside the Deaf community's advocacy for
        recognition and rights.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>

        LSV is widely used by Deaf individuals, their families, interpreters, and educators in Venezuela. It serves as a
        fundamental means of communication and plays a significant role in promoting Deaf culture and identity.
