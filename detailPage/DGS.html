    <h2>German Sign Language</h2>

    <p><strong>German Sign Language (Deutsche Gebärdensprache - DGS)</strong> is the primary sign language used by the
        Deaf community in Germany. DGS has a rich history and is recognized as a full language, distinct from both
        spoken and written German.</p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>Although DGS has been used by Deaf communities in Germany for centuries, it was only officially recognized as a
        language in 2002. Its development can be traced back to the 19th century, when schools for the Deaf were
        established in Germany.</p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>DGS is used across Germany by the Deaf community, as well as by hearing people who work closely with Deaf
        individuals. It is recognized by the German government and taught in schools for the Deaf, and as a foreign
        language in some universities.</p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of DGS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>DGS uses a combination of hand shapes, facial expressions, and body postures to convey meaning.</li>
        <li>Word order in DGS often follows a different structure than spoken German, such as a topic-comment sentence
            structure.</li>
        <li>DGS is known for its iconic signs, which visually resemble their meanings.</li>
    </ul>
