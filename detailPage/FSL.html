    <h2>Filipino Sign Language (FSL)</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Filipino Sign Language (FSL)</strong> is the sign language used by the Deaf community in the
        Philippines. It is a fully developed language with its own grammar and vocabulary, separate from spoken
        Filipino.
    </p>

    <h3>History and Origin</h3>
    <p>
        FSL has developed over time, influenced by various regional sign languages and local gestures. It gained
        recognition as the national sign language of the Philippines through the implementation of the National Council
        on Disability Affairs (NCDA) and the establishment of the FSL Recognition Act in 2009.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage and Community</h3>
    <p>
        FSL is used by Deaf individuals, their families, and interpreters in various settings. It serves as an essential
        means of communication, promoting awareness of Deaf culture and the rights of Deaf individuals in society.
    </p>

    <h3>Distinct Features of FSL</h3>
