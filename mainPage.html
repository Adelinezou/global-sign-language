        <p id="photod">As of 2024, approximately 20% of the global population, or more than 1.5 billion people, live
            with
            some form of
            hearing loss.
            This includes about 430 million individuals with disabling hearing loss. The impact of hearing loss on
            individuals and society is profound, affecting communication, education, employment, and mental health.
            Sign languages (also known as signed languages) are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey
            meaning, instead of spoken words. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulation in combination
            with non-manual markers.

            Just like the languages we speak daily, there are different kinds of sign languages around the world. There
            are
            over 300 kinds of sign languages globally, but people who do not have hearing loss often assume that there
            is
            only one kind of sign language. There is a map on the side created 11 years ago depicting the principal sign
            language families of the world. This website is created to raise awareness about the challenges faced by
            people
            with hearing loss and to organize some of the most used sign languages around the world.
